Reading Innovate Serial Protocol version 2 (ISP2)
=================================================

Purpose
-------

This code was developed for reading data from a TC-4, with protocol
testing occuring with an LC-1. Development and tested occured on OSX
with plans to eventually run on a raspberry pi. Since OSX at the time
this was developed ships with python2.7 installed, this code is designed
to run under python2.7.

The goal with the TC-4 is to read multiple temperature inputs, log to disk,
and provide real time display and analysis.
